"""stream chunk baseline: the historical single-vector interleave [cmd_0, obs_0, cmd_1, obs_1, ...]
— BIT-IDENTICAL to the pre-axis harness behavior: collate/flatten delegate to the exact
seq_worldmodel functions the harness always called, extract_cmd_pred is the same [:, 0::2] slice,
and leakage_ok is the same probe (same seed, same toy sequence, same perturbed index). A genome
with {"stream": {"impl": "baseline_interleave"}} — or no stream chunk at all — must reproduce
every archived fitness exactly. This is the plumbing check for the new axis.

Contract for any stream impl:
  collate(batch, device) -> dict with tok [B,L,D], types [B,L] in {0,1}, key_pad [B,L] bool,
      tgt [B,maxn,D] (single-vector standardized next-obs target per STEP — the target/eval space
      is FIXED across streams), cmd_mask [B,maxn] bool
  extract_cmd_pred(pred_full [B,L,D], batch) -> [B,maxn,D]  # prediction at each step's cmd token
  flatten_predictions(net, seqs, device) -> dict with at least pred/prev/true/cmds/verbs, step order
  leakage_ok(net, device) -> bool  # stream-aware causality probe (corrupt obs_t, cmd_<=t frozen)
