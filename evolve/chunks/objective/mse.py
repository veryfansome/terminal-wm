"""Contract for any objective impl: expose `loss(pred, tgt) -> scalar tensor` carrying grad.
  pred: [n, D] predicted next-observation embeddings at command positions
  tgt : [n, D] the tensor produced by the target axis, aligned row-for-row with pred
Both are the flattened cmd-position tensors for the training batch, so batch-level objectives
can be formed from them directly. Must be anti-collapse-safe: a constant prediction must not
minimize it.

CONTRACT EXTENSION (opt-in): a module may set `WANTS_CTX = True`, which changes the signature
to `loss(pred, tgt, ctx) -> scalar`. `ctx` is a dict aligned row-for-row with pred/tgt:
  ctx["cmd"]:  [n, D] the COMMAND embedding that produced each prediction (a model input)
  ctx["prev"]: [n, D] the strict-causal previous-observation embedding per cmd-row
Both are causal, so the no-future-leakage contract still holds. Modules without the flag are
called `loss(pred, tgt)`."""
